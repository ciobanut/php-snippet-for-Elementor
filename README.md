This snippet helps you insert wordpress variables into pages or posts created with Elementor for free.

To use this snippet you must have a WordPress website with [Elementor free](https://wordpress.org/plugins/elementor/) version.
I also recommend using the [Code Snippets plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/code-snippets/). But you can also place the code in the functions.php file.

## How to use

Just copy the code of the snippet.php file and paste it in the functions.php file or in Code Snippets on your website. Save and activate for front-end.

Create a new page or article with Elementor. Add any widget in which you can add text: header, text editor, button,... and paste any placeholder you need. For example: `{{ post_title }}`. Save and see the result.
